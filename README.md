Chrome Extension To Random Cat Facts

# To Setup
Go to chrome://extensions in your browser, or simply click "More Tools" and
"Extensions" on the chrome menu. This should lead you to Extension Management
page, where you can turn on Developer Mode (it should be in the top right
corner).

Click on "Load Unpacked" button and select the root directory. This is for
development purposes only. I have not release this to anyone else and the
pictures may not be free to use.
